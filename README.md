**1. The Economist Visualization Recreation:**

In this project, I attempt to recreate a visualization that is close in similarity to the one shown in The Economist's article below.

This files attached are as follows:
Original Source Visualization.png - The Original Visual in the Economist article (SOURCE ARTICLE LISTED BELOW)
The Economist Data Visualization Project.R - The code written with the intent to closely mimic the Original Source Visualization
The Economist Visualization Recreation.png - Image file of my recreation
Economist_Assignment_Data.csv - The Economist Dataset for the visualization (also used for my recreation)
