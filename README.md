**2. Data Capstone Project**

This is a capstone project for a MOOC from Udemy. (Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp with R). I work with provided datasets regarding MLB players statistics and salaries.

*The Scenario:* It is year 2001 and I am on the analytics team for the Oakland Athletics and we lose three players who provide our team with positive production. 

*The Goal:* To find three replacement players who could bring similar or better production for the same or lower cost.

- Salary.csv - Dataset containing all MLB player salaries
- Batting.csv - Dataset containing all MLB player batting statistics
